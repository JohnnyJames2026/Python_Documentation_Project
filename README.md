This project is yet another freeCodeCamp project as a part of the Responsive Web Design course that I am taking part of. This project incorporates CSS and HTML to create a smaller-scale, focused Python documentation web page. It will not include many of the features that Python has to offer, but it includes the basic skills needed to know for basic programming in Python. There are 5 sections, those being: Introduction, Initialization, If statements, Loops, and Functions, respectively. Each section contains information coming from the actual Python documentation page, so it is important to note that much of the "technical" content is referenced from that official website.
