            <p>Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that is widely used across various industries and disciplines. Known for its simplicity and readability, Python emphasizes code clarity and developer productivity. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming. Pythonâ€™s extensive standard library and active community provide tools for everything from web development and automation to data analysis, machine learning, and more. Whether you are a beginner learning to code or an experienced developer building large-scale applications, Python is an excellent choice for both simple scripts and complex projects.</p>

            <br>
            <p>The first thing to know is what is a variable.</p>
            <p>A variable contains data types such as:<br></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Integers</li>
                <li>Strings</li>
                <li>Booleans</li>
                <li>Float</li>
                <li>Lists</li>
                <li>Tuples</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>An integer is any number, as long as it is not a decimal.</p>
            <p>A string is any character you can type, and it is read with no numeric value.</p>
            <p>A boolean are logic data types such as True or False, and (and, or, not)</p>
            <p>Floats are basically integers, but they are only decimals. These numbers can go to any decimal place</p>
            <p>A list is a group of different data types, and they are all stored within this container. Lists can be parced and contents can be accessed.</p>
            <p>A tuple is like a list, but a tuple can not be changed and it is ordered.</p>
            <p>variables and data types, hello world,print </p><br>
            <p>Below are some examples of each:</p>
            <code>
                a = 4 #int<br><br>

                name = "susy" #string <br><br>

                answer = True #boolean  <br><br>

                decimal_value = 5.532 #float <br><br>

                names = ["susy, maggie, lily, rebeccaa"] #list of strings <br>
                nums = [1, 5, 3, 66, 23, 2] #list of integers <br>
                jumble = ["aaron", "robert", 2, "isaac", 33] #list of strings and integers <br><br>

                group = ("Aaron", 2) #tuple 

            </code><br><br><br>

            <p>Now, lets see how we can use these data types and variables to solve logical problems...</p>

        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="If-Statements">
            <header>If Statements</header><br>
            <p>The if statement is a conditional control structure that allows you to execute certain code only when a specific condition is met. It evaluates a given expression, and if the result is True, the block of code associated with the if statement runs. If the condition evaluates to False, the program skips the block or evaluates any subsequent elif or else statements.</p>
            <p>An example would go as follows:</p>
            <code>
                x = 10<br><br>

                if x > 5:<br>
                    print("x is greater than 5")
            </code><br><br>
            <p>There are also conditions for the if statement called else and elif. If a condition is false, the code will immediately execute the lines following "else". If there is an elif in the conditional chain and the first if was false, then the code will evaluate the elif statement for True or False. If this is wrong, else is the final line ran along with it's following statements.</p>
            <p>Continuing from our last example...:</p>
            <code>
                x = 10<br><br>

                if x > 15:<br>
                    print("x is greater than 5")<br>
                elif x == 10:<br>
                    print("x is equal to 10")<br>
                else:<br>
                    print("x is less than 10")<br>
            </code><br><br><br>
            <p>The next topic is over iteration through loops</p>


        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Loops">
            <header>Loops</header><br>
            <p>Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times, making it easier to handle repetitive tasks without writing the same code over and over. In Python, there are two main types of loops:</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>for loop</li>
                <li>while loop</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or other iterable objects. With each iteration, the loop assigns the next item in the sequence to a variable and runs the indented block of code.</p>
            <p>For example, this is some code that iterates through a list:</p>
            <code>
                fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br><br>
                for fruit in fruits:<br>
                    print(fruit)<br><br>
                #also iterate a certain number of times. This is looping 5 times<br>
                for i in range(5):<br>
                    print(i)
            </code><br><br>
            <p>Now, the while loop runs as long as a specified condition remains True. It evaluates the condition before executing the code block, and if the condition is True, it executes the block and then rechecks the condition.</p>
            <code>
                x = 0<br><br>
                while x < 5: <br>
                    print(x)<br>
                    x += 1
            </code><br><br>
            <p>The only catch to the while loop is you must increment the iterating variable, as the example shows in x. This is the only way to iterate thte loop in steps. Otherwise, this will result in a never ending loop.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
            <header>Functions</header><br>
            <p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow you to write code once and use it multiple times, making your programs more organized and modular. In Python, you can define your own functions or use built-in functions.</p>
            <h2>Defining a Function</h2>
            <p>You define a function using the def keyword followed by the function name, parentheses, and a colon. Inside the parentheses, you can include parameters that the function can take as input. The function body contains the code that runs when the function is called.</p>
            <code>
                def function_name(parameters):<br><br>
                #function which greets a person<br>
                def greet(name):<br>
                    print("Hello, " + name)
            </code><br><br>
            <h2>Calling a Function</h2>
            <p>Once a function is defined, you call it by writing the function name followed by parentheses. If the function takes parameters, you pass the arguments inside the parentheses.</p>
            <code>
                greet("Alice")
            </code><br><br>
            <h2>Function Parameters</h2>
            <p>A function can accept any number of parameters, separated by commas. You can also set default values for parameters or use keyword arguments.</p>
            <code>
                def add_numbers(a, b): <br>
                    return a + b
            </code><br><br>
            <p>In this past example, the function returns a value. This means that when the function is called, the value that was calculated will be printed/used.</p>
